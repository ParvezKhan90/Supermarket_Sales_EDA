### Supermarket_Sales_EDA


Overview:

1. Data cleaning and manipulation done using python libraries numpy and pandas.

2. EDA is done using python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.


Problem Statement:

This is a supermarket sales data, the supermarket has 3 different branches in 3 different cities. We got to get deeper insights of quantity sold, income generated and more. In this sales data, also we can have a look on sales of different category of products purchased on different days and time of days. This is a data of 3 months in the year 2019.


Conclusion:
1. The sales of products in the supermarket depends highly on the time of day viz. low sales at opening time and high sales in evening.

2. If the sales is considered on daily and monthly basis, it is evenly distributed.

3. The gross income of all the supermarkets in each of the 3 cities is more or less the same.


Insights:

1. The highest correlation is 0.71 between Quantity and Tax, Quantity and Total Sales, Quantity and Cogs, Quantity and Gross Income.

2. The sales is highest at 2pm and good volume of sales is recorded around 5pm and 7pm.

3. The sales is recorded to be the lowest around 10pm, 3pm and 4pm.

4. Each of the 3 cities Yangon, Naypyitaw, Mandalay has got 1 branch each A, B and C with similar Gross Income.

5. The most sales is recorded in Home and lifestyle segment made by females.

6. In Branch A 'member customers' make more purchases and in Branch C purchases are made more by 'normal customers'.

7. Mostly Ewallet and Credit card is used for payments in all 3 branches.

8. The sales of Home and lifestyle products is quite high and evenly distributed in all 3 cities/branches, fashion accessories has got very low sales.

9. The unit prices of all product types is similar across all 3 cities in the range of 55-60.

10. Branch B leads in sales of Health and beauty and lowest sales of Fashion Accessories. Branch C leads in Electronic Accessories and Sports and travel.



Proposed Solutions:

1. Breakfast items should be promoted to increase sales at opening time, the sales between 4pm and 8 pm can be boosted through membership discounts and promotion of products for teen agers and senior citizens.

2. Different Membership discounts should be introduced for teenagers, families, senior citizens.

3. Male products should be added more in Home and Lifestyle segments. The supermarket needs to concentrate on specific timings of each category of products sold.

4. The supermarket should focus on masses and promote products of low and medium prices. Seasonal discounts should be held to increase sales.
